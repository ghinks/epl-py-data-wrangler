# EPL Predictor
 
## Rationale
In order to further some basic understanding of how to use Machine 
Learning I am creating this project as vehicle to learn.

## Current Items
- naming conventions for files etc, read pep
- find out what the setup.py file does and use it
- find out why fully qualified file names are necessary in the 
tests and fix it up
- test folder structure, all tests in one folder? Does it scale.
- travis testing, requires setup 
- create the form data from previous results

## Completed Items
- unit test coverage, run all unit tests from the command line, pytest has been adopted 
as the test runner
- find out the , remind your self , what __init__.py does
- take multiple files that are found from the dir pointed to
